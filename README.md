Food is the best mood changer, and that's
what we as Indians think of whenever there
is a good weather outside, don't we?
The following slides describe the basis on which the
recipes will be recommended to the user:

--> Confused with what to cook
for lunch because you don't
know what you can
make out of the ingredients
available at home?

--> How great would it be
if there is a pleasant
weather outside and
you get to know the
best recipes for the
weather?

-->We also thought of
recommending the
popular food recipes
based on the user's
current location.
