Food is the best mood changer, and that's
what we as Indians think of whenever there
is a good weather outside, don't we?
The app recommends the recipes to the user!

How great would it be if there is a pleasant weather outside and you get to know the best recipes for the weather?

We also thought of recommending the popular food recipes based on the user's current location.


## Functionality & Concepts Used:

Weather Stack API
OpenWeatherMap API
We created our own APIs by extracting required data from a few open source APIs!

### Tech Stack
Retrofit
Firebase
NodeJS for creating APIs
